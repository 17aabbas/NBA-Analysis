# NBA Analysis last 10 years </n>
## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamkumar121215/nba-stats-dataset-for-last-10-years </n>
### This is a large project utilizing three key data analysis tool (SQL, Python, PowerBi). I will also be creating a ML model for future ranks. 
### Note: I have a full dataset with both Playoff and regular season stats, but for our purposes I will be cleaning two CSV files via python (separating regular season and playoffs).
